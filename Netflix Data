In this SQL file, I am querying data from Netflix to answer a few questions.

Select Count(*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
Where titles.type= 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
Select MAX(date(date_added))  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
